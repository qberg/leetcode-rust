# 920. Number of Music Playlists

> **Question:** Your music player contains n different songs. You want to listen to goal songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:
>
> - Every song is atleast played once.
> - A song can only be played again only if k other songs have been played.>
> Given n, goal, and k, return the number of possible playlists that you can create. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.
